**Understanding Group Structure on Elliptic Curves**

Elliptic curves, central to modern cryptography, are mathematical objects that exhibit fascinating group properties. This blog explores the group structure of points on elliptic curves over a field.

### What is an Elliptic Curve?

An elliptic curve is a set of points satisfying the equation:

where and are constants such that the curve is non-singular ().

### Group Law on Elliptic Curves

Elliptic curves form an abelian group under a special addition operation. The group’s elements are the points on the curve, including a special "point at infinity" (), which acts as the identity element.

#### Key Properties of the Group:

1. **Identity**: is the identity element, satisfying for any point .
    
2. **Inverse**: For any point , its inverse is .
    
3. **Commutativity**: .
    
4. **Associativity**: .
